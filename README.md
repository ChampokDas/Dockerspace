# General Development Performance Tools in Docker

I use these tools across all my machines fairly frequently.

I will be making this semi-generic, but since I pretty much only operate on
GNU/Linux, there probably won't be a version of this that will be compatible
with other *Nix systems.

# Requirements

Docker v19.03+

Bash

Linux system

# Future
I may try some stuff on macOS, but I can't promise that this will work since
I do not actively develop on any systems with macOS. 

If you are so inclined, feel free to contribute. I probably won't be 
maintaining the macOS compatibility stuff if any should get added. 

For Singularity lovers, you might see a version of this somewhere soon.
